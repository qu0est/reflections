How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
YOU WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPARE AN OLDER VERSION WITH A NEW VERSION OF THE FILE. IT WOULD HELP SORT OUT ERRORS IN THE FILE. YOU COULD USE IT TO RECALL LOST INFORMATION. YOU COULD USE IT TO CORRECT INFORMATION. DROPBOX. GOOGLE DOCS. WIKIPEDIA WERE USED IN THE EXAMPLE TO SHOW FORMS OF VERSION CONTROL. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
PRO: YOU ARE ABLE TO SAVE IT WHEN YOU WANT YOU HAVE MORE FREEDOM. AUTO VERSIONS COULD END UP COMMITTING TOO MUCH. CON: BY MANUAL COMMITTING YOU COULD RUN THE ERROR OF FORGETTING TO SAVE YOUR WORK AT CRUCIAL MOMENT.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS LIKE GIT ALLOWS SAVING MULTIPLE FILES IN ONE COMMIT BECAUSE WEB DEVELOPERS, PROGRAMMERS AND OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEM WORKERS MAY NEED TO SAVE MULTIPLE FILES TO TRACK THEIR WORK. VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS LIKE GOOGLE DOCS USERS MAY NOT NEED TO SAVE MULTIPLE FILES AT ONCE. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 
GIT LOG ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT ALL COMMITS MADE TO A FILE OR FILES. GIT DIFF ALLOWS YOU TO COMPARE DIFFERENT COMMITS OR FILES. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
USING COMMANDS LIKE GIT LOG TO PULL THE COMMITS, AND GIT CHECKOUT TO LOOK FOR ERRORS IN SPECIFIC COMMITS AND GIT DIFF TO COMPARE COMMITS TO SEARCH FOR ERRORS OR BUGS. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
TO ESTABLISH DIRECTORIES, REPOSITIORIES, DEBUGGING

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
WHEN YOU INTIATE A REPOSITORY, YOU HAVE TO USE GIT INIT. IT WILL GIVE YOU A MESSAGE STATING WHERE IT IS BEING SET UP. YOU NEED TO DO IT TO SET UP A REPOSITORY.
